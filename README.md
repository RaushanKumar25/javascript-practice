# CHAPTER 1

# javascript-practice
A collection of exercises, notes, and mini-projects to strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts. Covers basics like variables, loops, functions, DOM manipulation, ES6+ features, and small interactive projects to apply learning in real-world scenarios.

# Chapter 1: JavaScript Console

What is the Console?
The console is a tool built into web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) that helps developers test and debug code.

>It shows messages, errors, and results of your JavaScript code.
>You can open it by pressing F12 (or Right-Click → Inspect → Console tab).

Using the Console in JavaScript-
We use console.log() to print messages or results in the console.  
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
= Hello, JavaScript!

# What is a Programming Language?
:A programming language is a set of rules, symbols, and syntax that humans use to communicate with computers.

# Syntax: 
Structure of words in a sentence, Rules of the language, for programming exact syntax must be followed.
eg: > alert ("Hello World")

# Role of browser:
Display Webpage,
user click
Update content
Load files

# What is JavaScript
:- Javascript runs at the client side in the browser
Action: Enable Interactivity.
Updates: Alters path without reloading.
Event: Respond to user actions.
Data: fetches and send data to the server.
Role: Makes any website actaionable.

# Transpile: 
:Converting source code from one high-level language to another high-level language and then conver into maching language.
eg: kotlin convert the code into java code and then convert into machine language. 
: Transpile → high-level → high-level (human-readable, often same language but different version).
:-CoffeeScript / TypeScript are transpiled to javascript.

# Compile: 
:Converting source code (high-level language) into a lower-level language, often machine code that the computer can execute.
eg: C/C++ → compiled into machine code (.exe on Windows).
Transpile → high-level → high-level (human-readable)
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
# CHAPTER 2   

# mathematical operations
Arithmetic operations: are the basic mathematical operations we perform on numbers.

Operation	Symbol	Example (5 and 2)	Result
Addition	+	5 + 2	7
Subtraction	-	5 - 2	3
Multiplication	*	5 * 2	10
Division	/	5 / 2	2.5
Modulus (Remainder)	%	5 % 2	1
Exponentiation	**	5 ** 2	25

# Order of Operations (Operator Precedence)
:When more than one operator is used in a mathematical expression, the order matters.
This is defined by BODMAS / PEMDAS Rule:

B/P → Brackets/Parentheses () [] {}
O/E → Order / Exponentiation ^ or **
D → Division /
M → Multiplication *
A → Addition +
S → Subtraction -
