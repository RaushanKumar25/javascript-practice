# javascript-practice
A collection of exercises, notes, and mini-projects to strengthen my understanding of core JavaScript concepts. Covers basics like variables, loops, functions, DOM manipulation, ES6+ features, and small interactive projects to apply learning in real-world scenarios.

# Chapter 1: JavaScript Console

What is the Console?
The console is a tool built into web browsers (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge) that helps developers test and debug code.

>It shows messages, errors, and results of your JavaScript code.
>You can open it by pressing F12 (or Right-Click → Inspect → Console tab).

Using the Console in JavaScript-
We use console.log() to print messages or results in the console.  
console.log("Hello, JavaScript!");
= Hello, JavaScript!

# What is a Programming Language?
:A programming language is a set of rules, symbols, and syntax that humans use to communicate with computers.

# Syntax: 
Structure of words in a sentence, Rules of the language, for programming exact syntax must be followed.
eg: > alert ("Hello World")

# Role of browser:
Display Webpage,
user click
Update content
Load files

# What is JavaScript
:- Javascript runs at the client side in the browser
Action: Enable Interactivity.
Updates: Alters path without reloading.
Event: Respond to user actions.
Data: fetches and send data to the server.
Role: Makes any website actaionable.

# Transpile: 
:Converting source code from one high-level language to another high-level language and then conver into maching language.
eg: kotlin convert the code into java code and then convert into machine language. 
: Transpile → high-level → high-level (human-readable, often same language but different version).
:-CoffeeScript / TypeScript are transpiled to javascript.

# Compile: 
:Converting source code (high-level language) into a lower-level language, often machine code that the computer can execute.
eg: C/C++ → compiled into machine code (.exe on Windows).
Transpile → high-level → high-level (human-readable)
                                                                                                    
                                                                                                    
#                                                                                             CHAPTER 2   

# mathematical operations
Arithmetic operations: are the basic mathematical operations we perform on numbers.

Operation	Symbol	Example (5 and 2)	Result
Addition	+	5 + 2	7
Subtraction	-	5 - 2	3
Multiplication	*	5 * 2	10
Division	/	5 / 2	2.5
Modulus (Remainder)	%	5 % 2	1
Exponentiation	**	5 ** 2	25

# Order of Operations (Operator Precedence)
:When more than one operator is used in a mathematical expression, the order matters.
This is defined by BODMAS / PEMDAS Rule:

B/P → Brackets/Parentheses () [] {}
O/E → Order / Exponentiation ^ or **
D → Division /
M → Multiplication *
A → Addition +
S → Subtraction -

# Number Types in JavaScript: Integer and Float
: In JavaScript, all numbers are treated as the same Number type.

1. Integer (Whole Numbers):- A number without any decimal point.
Example: 5, -3, 1000, 0

let age = 25;
let count = -10;
console.log(age);   // 25
console.log(count); // -10
----------------------------

2. Float (Decimal Numbers):- A number that has a decimal point.
example: Example: 3.14, -0.5, 2.718

let price = 19.99;
let temperature = -4.5;
console.log(price);        // 19.99
console.log(temperature);  // -4.5
------------------------------

Checking if a Number is an Integer

You can use Number.isInteger() to check if a value is an integer.
console.log(Number.isInteger(5));    // true
console.log(Number.isInteger(5.5));  // false
--------------------------------

# Rounding Floats

You can round floats to whole numbers using:

:Math.round() → rounds to the nearest integer
:Math.floor() → rounds down
:Math.ceil() → rounds up

console.log(Math.round(4.7)); // 5
console.log(Math.floor(4.7)); // 4
console.log(Math.ceil(4.1));  // 5
---------------------------------
# conclusion 

Summary:

JavaScript has one number type, but we think of them as integers (whole numbers) and floats (decimal numbers).
You can mix them in calculations.
You can check if a number is an integer using Number.isInteger().
You can round floats using Math.round(), Math.floor(), or Math.ceil().

# String: 
:string holds the textual data anything from a single chracter to the paragraphs.
: strings can be defined as single quotes 'hello javascript, double quotes: "hello javascript, and or backticks: `hello javascript`

# Type of Operator:
it checks the variable tells you the datatype of variable.
: syntax= typeof.  eg: typeof 5 = 'number'

# querySelector 
:querySelector is a method that selects and returns the first element in the document that matches a specified CSS selector.
syntax: document.querySelector("CSS selector");

# querySelectorAll
: querySelectorAll is a method that selects all elements that match a specified CSS selector and returns them as a NodeList (a list of elements).
its like "Find all these elements on the page so I can work with each of them.”
syntax: document.querySelectorAll("CSS selector");


# CHAPTER 4

# variable
:A variable is like a container or label where you can store data (such as numbers, text, etc.)

Why do we need variables?

:To store values.
:To reuse information without typing it again.
:To make programs dynamic and interactive.

How to declare a variable  by using let

let name = "Roshan";
let age = 22;
console.log(name);
console.log(age);  

Here:

name is a variable storing text "Roshan"
age is a variable storing the number 22

:Variable names can contain letters, digits, $, and _.
:Cannot start with a digit.
:Variables help you write reusable and organized code.

# Eval function
eveal function convert the two string value into mathematical expression.

# CHAPTER 5

#Boolean 
:A boolean is a type that can only have two values:
✔ true
✔ false
A boolean is like a yes or no, on or off, right or wrong answer.
It’s used when you want to decide something or check conditions in your program.

:Why are booleans important?

Control decisions — like showing or hiding things.
Check conditions — compare values or states.
Make your program smarter — it reacts differently based on true or false.

# Comparison Operators
:Comparison operators compare two values and return a boolean — either true or false

Operator	Meaning	Example	Result
==	equal to	5 == 5	true
===	exactly equal (value and type)	5 === "5"	false
!=	not equal	5 != 3	true
!==	not exactly equal	5 !== "5"	true
>	greater than	10 > 5	true
<	less than	3 < 5	true
>=	greater than or equal	5 >= 5	true
<=	less than or equal	4 <= 5	true

# What is === (triple equal) in JavaScript?
: The triple equal (===) is called the strict equality operator.
It checks:

If two values are equal
AND

If they are of the same type (number, string, etc.)

Only if both are true, it returns true. Otherwise, it returns false.

# Truthy and Falsy Value

# Falsy Value in JavaScript:
: A value that is considered false when evaluated in a Boolean context (like inside an if condition).

# Truthy Value in JavaScript:
: A value that is considered true when evaluated in a Boolean context.

# In short:

Falsy = behaves like false
Truthy = behaves like true

# Falsy values (only 8 in total!)

: These are the values that JavaScript treats as false in a condition:

false (boolean false itself)
1: 0 (number zero)
2: -0 (negative zero)
3: 0n (BigInt zero)
4: "" (empty string: single quotes '', double quotes "", or backticks ``````)
5: null
6: undefined
7: NaN (Not-a-Number)

# Truthy values

: Everything else that is not falsy is truthy.

# If Alternatives

1: if...else statement (the basic one)
-Definition: Runs one block of code if the condition is true, otherwise another block.
2: Ternary Operator (? :)   condition ? true : false 
-Definition: A shorthand for if...else that works in a single line.
3: Guard Operator (OR ||) 
- The OR guard operator (||) is used to provide a default value when the first value is falsy.


# CHAPTER 6

# FUNCTION
:Function: A reusable piece of code that can take inputs, process them, and optionally return a result.

-Why use functions?
>Reusability – write once, use many times
>Organization – makes code cleaner
>Parameters & results – handle different inputs dynamically
>Avoid repetition – easier to maintain

# What are Parameters in JavaScript?
: Parameters are like placeholders (inputs) that you define in a function.
# Arguments 
: When you call the function, you pass arguments (real values) to those parameters.

eg:  function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}

greet("Roshan");   // Output: Hello, Roshan!
greet("Ashish");   // Output: Hello, Ashish!

 Here:
name → parameter (placeholder inside the function).
"Roshan" / "Ashish" → arguments (actual values you pass when calling).


# default values
: when we define a value of paramenter in a function is called default value. in case of arguments are not ded=fined it will call the default value of parameters.
eg: function greet(name = "Guest") {
    console.log("Hello, " + name);
}

greet("Roshan"); // Output: Hello, Roshan
greet();         // Output: Hello, Guest

here,
name = "Guest" → Here "Guest" is the default value.
When you call greet("Roshan"), it prints "Hello, Roshan".
When you call greet() without arguments, it automatically uses "Guest". (takes the default value)

# CHAPTER: 7

# Object in JavaScript
:An object is a collection of key-value pairs.

:Keys (or properties) are names.
:Values can be anything: numbers, strings, arrays, functions, or even other objects.

> let person = {
    name: "Roshan",
    age: 20,
    city: "Patna"
};

Here:
>name, age, city → keys (properties)
>"Roshan", 20, "Delhi" → values

# Objects Can Hold Anything Inside

: Primitive values:
:Arrays inside objects:
:Functions inside objects (Methods)
:Objects inside objects

eg: let obj = {
    name: "Ashish",
    address: {
        city: "Pune",
        pincode: 110001
    }
};
console.log(obj.address.city); // pune


# AUTOBOXING
: Automatic conversion of premitive to object is called Autoboxing
> Allow properties and method to be used on premitive.



# CHAPTER 8


# JSON
:A lightweight data format used for storing and sharing data.
:It looks just like a JavaScript object, but it is actually written as plain text (string).

# Why do we use JSON?
> To store data
> To send and receive data
> Easy to understand

:Without JSON, it would be very hard for different systems to talk to each other.

:JSON is a text-based format used to store and share data between programs. It looks like a JavaScript object but is written as a string. In JavaScript, we use JSON.stringify() to convert objects into JSON, and JSON.parse() to turn JSON back into objects.

# What is Local Storage?

:Local Storage is like a small storage box inside your browser (like Chrome, Edge, Firefox, etc.).
:It allows you to save data directly on the user’s computer, and the data does not get deleted even if you close or refresh the browser.

> setItem = put data in the browser’s storage.
>getItem = take data back from the browser’s storage.
